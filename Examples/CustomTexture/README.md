# CustomTexture

Demonstration of how to implement a custom 3d texture using a `<canvas>`.
In the runtime (client.js), a custom texture is created with a canvas that is
updated each frame to show a framerate meter.
In the React application (index.vr.js), the custom texture is referenced and
used as the texture for a `<Box>`.
