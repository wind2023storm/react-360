The VrButton is a utility class that detects click-type actions across a variety of input devices. It does this by implementing an internal state machine that listens to key-down events, followed by key-up events, while the cursor remains on the component. By default, a VrButton has no appearance and will only act as a wrapper to capture events, but it can be styled in the same ways as a View.
