If React VR doesn't support a feature that you need, you can build it yourself.

Sometimes an app needs access to a platform API that React VR doesn't have a corresponding module for yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing JavaScript code without having to re-implement it in the React context. Or, you want to write some high performance, multi-threaded code for image processing, a database, or other advanced extensions.

This is a more advanced feature and we don't expect it to be part of the usual development process, however it is essential that it exists.

## Cube Example
One example of using Native Modules is to support interaction between a React VR UI element and a custom Three.js object that you've added to your scene, for example a geometric cube similar to the one in the [Three.js README](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

### Setting up the Scene
The React VR framework can handle the camera and renderer setup for you, so you only need to focus on adding objects to your scene and animating them. First, we create the scene in the `init` function of `vr/client.js` (one of the files provided as part of the Starter Project) and provide it as an option to the `VRInstance` constructor.  We also create `CubeModule`, a Native Module described later in this section.
```
  const scene = new THREE.Scene();
  const cubeModule = new CubeModule();

  const vr = new VRInstance(bundle, 'CubeSample', parent, {
    cursorVisibility: 'visible',
    nativeModules: [ cubeModule ],
    scene: scene,
  });
```
Next, we create the cube mesh and add it to the scene.  We use the same Three.js operations as we normally would, with a couple modifications which are often necessary to make Three.js objects appear correctly in React VR.

* React VR uses units of 1 meter, so we use cube dimensions of 1 instead of 100.
* The VRInstance camera is at the origin, so we change the z position of the cube so it is visible.

```
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
    new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()
  );
  cube.position.z = -4;
  scene.add(cube);
  cubeModule.init(cube);
```
Above, we also initialize the `cubeModule` with a handle to the cube.  Finally, add the per-frame update logic into the `vr.render` method.
```
  vr.render = function(timestamp) {
    const seconds = timestamp / 1000;
    cube.position.x = 0 + (1 * (Math.cos(seconds)));
    cube.position.y = 0.2 + (1 * Math.abs(Math.sin(seconds)));
  };
```
### Using the Native Module
Let's say we want the cube to change color based on UI interaction such as a button click.  Here is a Native Module that implements the `changeCubeColor` function, which is called asynchronously across the React Native bridge.  The `constructor` and `init` methods are called directly in `client.js` to setup the module, as shown above.
```
export default class CubeModule extends Module {
  constructor() {
    super('CubeModule');
  }
  init(cube) {
    this.cube = cube;
  }
  changeCubeColor(color) {
    this.cube.material.color = new THREE.Color(color);
  }
}
```
Now we can call the `changeCubeColor` method from `index.vr.js`, for example in an `onClick` handler.
```
import NativeModules from 'react-vr';
...
const CubeModule = NativeModules.CubeModule;
...
render() {
...
  <VrButton
    onClick={()=>CubeModule.changeCubeColor(hexColor)}>
  ...
  </VrButton>
..

```

See the `CubeSample` for the full code of this example.
