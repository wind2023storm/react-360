Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated` library is designed to make them fluid, powerful and easy to build and maintain. `Animated` makes it possible to toggle the size, position, and appearance of elements in your scene in a declarative style that fits into React.

The `Animated` library was originally implemented from React Native, and that is the version we use. To understand how it works, we recommend reading through [the React Native documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html).
