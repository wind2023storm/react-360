/**
 * Surface is an object used to place 2D layers in 3D space. It is optimized
 * for the resolution of that surface, and allows developers to think in pixels
 * instead of spatial coordinates. A surface is defined in terms of pixel size
 * and angular density, and the geometry is generated accordingly.
 * Surfaces are available in the following shapes:
 *  - Cylinder, places UI content on the inside of a cylinder wrapped around
 *    the user. This means that every pixel on the surface will be viewed
 *    straight-on, and not from an angled perspective.
 *    The default Cylinder has a radius of 4 meters, and a density of 4680px
 *    per 2Ï€ radians.
 *    NOTE: Due to WebGL 1.0 restrictions, the maximum width is 4096, so you
 *    need to reduce the density to create a UI that wraps all the way around.
 *  - Flat, places UI content on a quadrilateral panel. The panel is positioned
 *    tangent to a sphere, meaning that the center point will always be viewed
 *    straight-on. The position of the panel on the outside of the sphere is
 *    determined through yaw (rotation around the y axis) and pitch (rotation
 *    around the x axis) angles. Yaw rotation will move it horizontally around
 *    the sphere, and pitch rotation will move it vertically between the ground
 *    and the ceiling. The default sphere radius is 4 meters.
 * It is possible to re-shape a Surface without destroying it, allowing a main
 * React surface to be dynamically reshaped depending on the contents. Calling
