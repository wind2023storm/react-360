# webgl-ui-sdf-font

This package contains a text rendering implementation that uses Signed Distance
Function fonts to render text. SDF fonts have the advantage of easily rendering
at any size with smooth edges. However, they require shipping special font files
that add to application size, and must be pre-computed.
